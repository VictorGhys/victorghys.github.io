									Boo-Ya is a <b>3D arcade game</b> about a ghost that scares residents in a haunted hotel. 
									And tries to break a highscore doing so. 
									But you must watch out to not get caught by the ghost hunters. 
									This game made as a school <b>group project</b> by a group of 4 people. 
									Two programmers Lars Bracke and me and two artists <a href="https://sketchfab.com/FreijaDeGraeve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freija De Graeve</a> and <a href="https://pimjacobs.artstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pim Jacobs</a>. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The idea of the game was to make a reverse pacman game where you play as the ghost, mixed with luigi's mansion. 
									I was <b>in charge of</b> all the code for the <b>player and the ghosthunter</b>. 
									I also coded the UI and other small things to pollish and ship the game.
									The main challenges of this game were the <b>npc behaviors</b>. 
									Because we needed to make sure the npc's did't feel too stupid but still felt fun to play agains.
									The game was voted <b>second</b> out of the 32 entries and we were very happy with that result.
								</p>
								<p>
									The game is made with <b>Unity</b> and coded in c#. 
									For the npc behaviors we used Behavior Bricks, a plugin to facilitate the making of the <b>behavior tree</b>. 
									The camera shake was done with the Milkshake plugin. 
									We also used an outline plugin to show an outline around objects you can interact with.
								</p>

								<p>
									I learned to work together in a team with artists. 
									I also learned that with a small team of skilled people and a good concept you can make great games (most other teams where 5 or 6 people). 
									The importance of <b>discussing game features</b> and asking for quick feedback from the others became clear to me. 
									This <b>communication is important</b> because it improves the quality and creativity of the game and you are also better informed of what your colleagues are doing.
