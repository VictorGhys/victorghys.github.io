									Work It is an <b>exergame</b> where you need to help villagers. 
									The game uses an <b>Azure Kinect</b> to track your whole body. 
									This game was made for a group project at Digital Arts & Entertainment for our client the <b>Sports Innovation Campus</b> in Bruges.
									It was made by two programmers <a href="https://be.linkedin.com/in/jonasderidder64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonas De Ridder</a> and me, two artists <a href="https://gabrielsart.artstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arno Gabriels</a> and Jarno Van Roy and two IGP students Yorick Bongaerts and Toon Van Huynegem.
								</p>
								<p>
									I mainly worked on the <b>gameplay of the levels</b> and <b>AI of the villager npcs</b>. 
									I also did some technical art when working with the <b>Unreal water system</b>. 
									At the start of the project, we were also allowed to use an HTC Vive and its trackers. 
									I made a <b>prototype in Unity and Unreal engine with the Vive</b>. 
									But in the end, we decided that the full body tracking of the Kinect would lead to a better game and experience. 
									The game turned out great and the client was very happy with it. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The game is made with <b>Unreal Engine 4</b> and most is coded in <b>c++ with a little bit of blueprints</b>. 
									It runs on a <b>double beamer setup</b>, one for the wall screen and one for the floor.
