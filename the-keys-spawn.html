								<p>
									The Keys Spawn! is a <b>2D puzzle game</b>. 
									Your goal is to reach the end to complete the puzzle. 
									But there is a twist <b>every key you press on your keyboard spawns as a pysical object in the level</b> you are playing. 
									This makes for a pretty interesting mix between a puzzle game and a platformer.
								</p>
								<p>
									This time I didn't get to participate in a team. 
									I was traveling a lot during the jam and could not dedicate 100% of my time to it. 
									Regardless I'm still very happy with the game I made in the limited time. 
									I received lots of positive comments and feedback on the game.
								</p>
								<p>
									The game was made for the <b>GMTK game jam 2023</b> in <b>48 hours</b>. 
									The theme was <b>"Roles reversed"</b>. 
									The game was <b>260th</b> overall out of 6837 entries, which is in the <b>top 3%</b>. 
									And I'm particularly happy with getting <b><u>18th</u> place in the creativity criterea</b>!
									Made in <b>Unity</b>.
